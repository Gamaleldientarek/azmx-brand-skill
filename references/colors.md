## The two-blues rule

The most important color rule in the system:

- **Electric `#001AFF`** is the primary accent on light surfaces. Sparse and decisive, like punctuation. Never a large fill behind text (it vibrates), never small Electric text on Navy (contrast fails).
- **Light Blue `#5D8FFF`** is the accent on dark surfaces, where Electric would be too dim. Also fine for large soft fills.

## Hairlines

1 px rules at Neutral 900 at 12% on light, White at 14% on dark. At most one Electric or Light Blue 2 px active rule per surface.
